Programming assignment 1

This is an implementation of A* search in SEPIA. The agent uses A* search to 
find a path to the town hall. When an enemy agent is on the field the agent will
check if his path is blocked by the enemy agent three turns in a row. If the 
enemy agent is in the way the agent will replan the path. The agent avoids 
committing to a worse path by storing the old path and checking if it becomes 
unblocked.

My code is all contained within shouldReplanPath, AstarSearch, and various 
private helper methods located below AstarSearch. Two class fields have been
added timesBlocked, which keeps track of the number of times the agent has been
blocked, and oldPath which stores the old path so the agent can check if it is
open again. 

MapLocation has also been updated with the hashCode(), and equals() functions
to allow for convenient use in data structures. A toString() function was also
added for debugging purposes.
